## Features
- Inline validation (name, email, strong password, confirm match) with instant error messaging.
- Animated “Sign up” button with ambient wave effect that runs by default.

- Glassmorphism-inspired styling with paired panels, social icons, and accessible focus states.

2) Fill the form with valid values and click “Sign up” to see the swap animation.  
3) Adjust styles in `style.css` and validation rules in `validation.js` as desired.
